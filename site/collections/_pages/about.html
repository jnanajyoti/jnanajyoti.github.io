        I was born and raised in Delhi, having moved to the US in 2017 to do my PhD. 
        I have a plethora of interests and hobbies outside of math, some of which I am absolutely passionate about. 
        My love for sports is second to none, playing sports and working out invigorates me and sustains me. 
        I was a professional badminton player back home and have represented Delhi at the national level many times. 
        My favourite sport these days is football (soccer). I also love travelling, music, dance and stand up comedy, 
        in no particular order of preference.
