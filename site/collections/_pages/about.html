      <p>
        
        I was born and raised in Delhi, having moved to the US in 2017 to do my PhD. 
        I have a plethora of interests and hobbies outside of math, some of which I am absolutely passionate about. 
        My love for sports is second to none, playing sports and working out invigorates me and sustains me. 
        I was a professional badminton player back home and have represented Delhi at the national level multiple times. 
        I also love travelling, music, dance and stand up comedy, in no particular order.
