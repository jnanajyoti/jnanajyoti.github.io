I was selected for **NSFâ€™s Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship Program for Summer 2022**. I worked at NASA and Caltech's joint ** Jet Propulsion Laboratory ** in Pasadena, CA for 10 weeks during the summer. I worked under the mentorship of **Huikyo Lee** and my project was to use Topological Data Analysis to study the shape of aerosol data collected by NASA satellites to better predict climate models. We used Python for this project.
