Under the supervision of my advisor, Prof William Menasco, I have been working with a group of engineers on a structural design project where the goal is to build special geometric structures with desired physical properties, using knots as the basic building blocks. 
Here's a piece of code I wrote for the engineering team. If you input co-prime numbers p and q, the code spits out a Legendrian parametrisation of a rational knot defined by (p,q).
